At Port 443 we work together, laugh together, and eat a lot of donuts together. (Have you seen our Instagram? It’s basically a food blog.) Our products (My Music Staff, TutorBird & AthletaDesk) are always evolving, making for an exciting and dynamic environment. Every day, we’re connecting with our thousands of users all around the world. If you ask them what they love about us, they’ll tell you that we really listen to their needs and go above and beyond to help. Our members are at the heart of everything we do. Their feedback and ideas help shape our products, and at the end of the day, we’re all here because of them… 




…and because of the donuts. 




About You

You’re a top-notch DevOps kind of person, with a strong emphasis on “Ops”. You’ve got practical experience with AWS and a passion for cyber security (but you probably don’t like the word “cyber” because… well, it’s just kind of weird). Perhaps you were a developer at one point but switched gears to infrastructure and networking (and still like to toss the developer hat back on every now and again!).




You like figuring out bottlenecks in systems and you’re a proactive problem solver. You use your development skills to automate routine tasks and you like defining infrastructure as code. Your interests lie at the intersection of software and infrastructure. You take pride in your work and you hate being on-call, so you work carefully to implement reliable infrastructure. You don’t mind chipping in to solve software and/or infrastructure problems around the office either! 




You’ve got: 

Strong understanding of cloud-native operations, technologies, principles, and infrastructure as code 
3 years of experience with core AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, RDS) 
3 years of configuration management or software development experience 
3 years of experience with build automation tools (TeamCity, Maven, or other) 
Experience writing scripts (e.g. bash, PowerShell, etc.) 
A diploma or degree in a relevant field 
Understanding and familiarity with one or more cyber security frameworks (your choice, come and tell us what you know) 

 

Your responsibilities will include: 

Support, automate and improve our AWS infrastructure 
Work closely with the development and QA teams to optimize the ongoing CI/CD strategies from source control through to product delivery 
Perform security audits and advise on best practices for data security 
Working with external service providers when necessary to ensure smooth email delivery from our SaaS platform 
Automate as much as possible (work smart, not hard!) 
Clearly document all processes and tools 

 

Meet the Team!




Dan is the founder & president of the company, so none of us would be here without him! 😊 He oversees everything going on at Port 443, and his hands are in a lot of the development projects. He’s the guy who makes sure that everything is always running smoothly. Lately, you can find Dan taking meetings while walking on the office treadmill desk! Fun fact: did you know you can suddenly develop an avocado allergy as an adult? Dan knows! 🥑 




Marc once let us decide the fate of his haircut by Slack poll and shaved his head! As a member of the back-end development team, he’s working on all the things “under the hood” that keep our products running. He’s always got the perfect thing to share in the #random channel, whether it’s his quarantine needlefelt animals or the adorable videos of his pets 😻 




Ranveer manages the development team and oversees the company’s finances. Ask anyone at the office to describe him and they’d say “Ranveer is so generous!” Ask them to expand on that and they would clarify that he shares his advent calendar chocolate with us every year! 🍫 For a good story, ask him about what happened with the UPS driver and the office door… 😬 




Other Perks/Benefits

Free snacks and coffee – are you Team Hazelnut or Team Regular? 
Company social events throughout the year – significant others welcome! 
Cool company swag when we reach milestones – check our IG to see some of our past swag 
Comprehensive health benefits plan – now you can stop putting off that dentist appointment! 




When you come to work at Port 443, you’re joining a team that balances innovation, excellence, and fun. If this sounds like the perfect fit for you, we want to hear why! To let us know why this job posting speaks to you and what you can bring to the table, send your cover letter, resume, and favourite donut flavour to careers@port443.io

Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Who are we:

RoofBundle is a rapidly growing venture backed tech startup disrupting the construction industry in North America.

Our team is made up of problem solvers and self-starters, who are all energized by fast-paced work and can adjust their footing swiftly on any given day. 







Our Story:

Our founder, David Peters, was an experienced roofing contractor for over a decade. After years of spending evenings and weekends manually creating quotes and bill of materials he saw an opportunity to reduce this time consuming process by creating a mobile app. The mobile app has an embedded calculation engine that allows roofers to input roofing dimensions while they are on the roof and based on these dimensions, the app will create a professional quote, a bill of materials and labour requirements within minutes. The app is also an organizational tool that can be used to track current and historical projects and upload before/after photos. Essentially, the time savings that roofing companies will get from using this app will improve the profitability of each job and also allow them to scale their business because they will have more time to actually install roofs.







We are looking for a Backend Developer / DevOps Engineer to join our collaborative team who will have an immediate impact on a young, fast growing startup company. We need someone that can help grow our business by crafting and iterating Roofbundle’s back-end real time architecture and technologies that power Roofbundle.

Develop improvement, upgrade, and maintain stability through monitoring, diagnostic capabilities, troubleshooting issues and conducting root-cause analysis.

We want someone to join us who is fully committed to our vision and sees this role as an exciting adventure.







Who are we looking for:




You are excited about making an impact with your talent through the use of technology

Common Wealth offers an award-winning digital retirement platform that helps Canadians achieve their goals. We are driven by our mission to help all Canadians achieve financial security in retirement. Common Wealth makes it easy to plan, save, and build a reliable retirement income - so our members can feel confident about their financial future. Common Wealth is the trusted retirement plan provider to a rapidly growing number of businesses, non-profits, associations, and unions across the country, and works in collaboration with benefits advisors, HR platforms, and other valued partners. Our team is growing to continue to support the lives of many Canadians through our mission. We are looking for an Intermediate Backend Engineer to join our team and make a significant contribution to our platform and the future of retirement in Canada. If you are curious feel free to click here to read more about us at Common Wealth.




What you will do:

Write and deliver code while understanding customer and business needs; once features are defined by the product team, our development team works to break it down into smaller pieces of work. As an intermediate developer, your work will be assigned from there. You will take requirements into consideration and understand the reasoning behind a particular requirement and challenge the approach if you feel there are better alternatives. You will also coordinate with our front-end team to ensure that what you’re building fits into the overall development landscape.
Work on testing and automation for what you’ve created; we don’t have a separate testing team in our engineering department, which means each developer on the team is responsible for writing and automating tests for what they’ve created. In addition to writing/automating these tests, you will also work with more senior developers to get feedback on your work. You will focus on the highest-quality implementations, recognizing the importance of our product in people’s financial lives.
Embrace a devops philosophy: Our infrastructure lives in the cloud, and is all managed using infrastructure-as-code tools. Engineers are responsible for understanding how their work runs in production, and are expected to think about cost, scalability, monitoring, and security when introducing new pieces of infrastructure. We are always exploring ways to improve how we deliver our product.




Who you are:

Curious, self-directed learner who thrives on ambiguity; from a technical perspective you can be rather junior in your skillset but your mindset needs to resemble a senior developer. What this means to us is that you’re excited by the challenge of getting a story from a product designer and you’re able to jump in and start implementing it and identify any questions you might have. You don’t need precise work requirements but can figure things out, and make the right judgement calls. You know when to ask for help and don’t mind doing so. Your initiative and eagerness to learn makes you a valuable team member.
Open-minded and willing to seek out feedback; you enjoy being part of a highly collaborative team that provides a lot of internal feedback. You never feel defensive when other people look at your work and provide opinions or ask questions. You’re open to different ways of doing things and willing to let go of a path you were on if the team feels there’s a better way.
Collaborative team member; you understand that great products are built through working with many different stakeholders. You are able to build strong relationships with other mission driven team members, including those outside of the engineering group. You enjoy working with our product team and hearing from our customers about how your work impacts them and our product.
Experience working as a Java developer; you have worked on products that are out in the market and can point to what you’ve built in your coding life. Our tech stack involves Java, Spring, Hibernate, Postgres, and AWS. Any experience working with the listed technologies, plus some exposure to automated testing is a bonus. You have worked on multiple projects where you have helped shape the backend architecture and understand how to establish architecture where none exists, seeing what is needed to reach an end state.




Why Work with us:

Common Wealth is a fast growing company with a mission to change the lives of Canadians. Joining our team of mission-driven developers means you have an incredible amount of autonomy over your day to day work, and can help to disrupt the Canadian retirement landscape. In addition to a competitive salary of $80-100k you will receive health and dental benefits, life insurance, an additional Health Spending Account, a 5% employer match into one of our award-winning group retirement plans, and four weeks of vacation. Our team is currently working remotely and we plan to continue that practice into the future. We have an office in downtown Toronto for those that prefer to work from the office. Our growing team combines deep expertise in the key disciplines necessary to help our customers achieve retirement success. We have also formed partnerships with world-class investment and annuities providers, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Brookfield Annuity, a leading provider of group annuities.




To Apply:

We are a respectful workplace committed to building a skilled and diverse workforce. We believe in fostering an inclusive work environment where all individuals have an opportunity to succeed. We welcome and encourage applications from everyone. We look forward to hearing from you!

We process payments, run marketplaces, detect fraud, reconcile finances, help entrepreneurs start internet businesses from anywhere in the world, build world-class developer-friendly APIs, and more. The reliability of our systems is critical to ensure that our users can confidently depend on Stripe to run and grow their businesses every day.

With the major increase in Stripe’s customer adoption, and scaleout of all product offerings, fundamentals such as security, reliability and supportability are vital to drive customer retention and revenue. We’re looking for a strong distributed systems engineer to join us and support large, cross-organizational initiatives to improve the reliability and performance of all our products. In this role you’ll work with the Reliability team to design, develop, and deploy innovative infrastructure software to ensure that Stripe software has the fundamental properties required to massively scale, including being resilient, observable, performant, and having a service oriented design.

You Will

Work with Staff engineers to design, implement, and deploy robust distributed services, making appropriate tradeoffs between reliability, throughput, latency, resiliency, engineering velocity and cost
Innovate, design and implement new products and prototypes to improve service resiliency, engineering velocity and management at scale
Contribute to engineering strategy, tooling, processes, and culture
Uphold our high engineering standards and improve our codebase and processes

You might be a fit for this role if you:

What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools to accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling hundreds of millions of API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.

We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

About you

We’re looking for someone with expert knowledge in ASP.Net Core and Web App development. Experience with microservices and at-scale web architectures is a bonus. More important that specific technical skills though is that you’re a strong problem solver who loves to learn – we’re not experts in everything and we don’t expect you to be either.

We are committed to working at a sustainable and healthy pace, we will provide you any equipment you need to do your best work, including computer, external displays, office chairs, keyboards, --whatever you need.




How to apply

To apply, write something specifically for this position that tells us why we’re a great fit for each other, and what you see the future being like if we work together. Please showcase 2-3 projects you’ve worked on recently and tell us what you think we should know about them. If you’ve got anything you designed, developed and shipped entirely by yourself, we’d really love to see it and hear the story.




We don’t ask for your resume, but that doesn’t mean we’re not interested in what you’ve worked on in the past, we’re just leaving it up to you to tell your story the way you want to tell it.
