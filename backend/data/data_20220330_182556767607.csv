Reports to: CTO

About Us:

The desire to express oneself is universal so it’s no surprise that a big trend on the internet is the creator economy. There are an estimated 50M creators online and many millions more consuming that content. There are platforms that service people teaching courses, making videos, selling their art, and writing blogs. 

INVRS is at the forefront of the creator economy with a platform serving the world of investing. Finance creators have unique needs: financial data & tools they can manipulate and share, an audience they can nurture and move down a sales funnel, and flexibility in the way they monetize. This is what INVRS delivers. We provide everything a finance creator needs for free and we take a cut of their revenue when they make a sale.

About You:

You love coding. You love getting to the root of a problem and figuring it out. You take pride in seeing a creation you’ve worked on come to life. You also have an entrepreneurial bent. You know that the world is changing at a tremendous pace, and you are interested in being part of the next big thing. You also like the idea of working in a company that’s more than happy to let you contribute ideas and insight. 

Welcome to Your First Job at INVRS

Your first job at INVRS will be to write automated regression tests in both Javascript and Java. We have an aggressive development schedule, so ensuring that nothing breaks as we add to our platform is vital. 

Despite the thoroughness of the tests you write, there will always be instances when software works in an unexpected way. Under the supervision of the CTO, you will gain experience problem solving as you look for the cause of these expectation misalignments. As you become more familiar with our architecture, you will work on projects which users will interact with, to develop software that will be part of the platform.  

Primary Responsibilities

Work with the CTO to enhance a fintech application in the investment analysis space. The successful candidate will have experience working in Java, JavaScript, the Spring Framework, Servlets, HTTP filters, Tomcat, SQL and object relational mapping tools (MyBatis, Hibernate, JPA). Understanding the front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Vue.js is helpful.

The incumbent will work on specific components of the application and will be integrating third party widgets and APIs. He/she will also be involved in adapting older features of the technology with the new application.

We believe that nobody should struggle financially to receive healthcare. Every year, 500,000 families in the United States declare bankruptcy due to large medical bills. People should not have their lives destroyed because they can’t afford something they require to survive. At Walnut, we’re on a mission to change this number from 500,000 bankruptcies per year to 0.

What we do

Walnut is a fintech company that expands financial access to healthcare. We’re building a point-of-sale embedded lending platform that makes healthcare more affordable for patients by breaking up large medical bills into small, monthly payments. This helps patients actually afford healthcare and helps healthcare providers capture more revenue and increase collections. We’re backed by prominent investors including Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused venture fund), Plaid, Afore Capital, 2048 Ventures, Newark Venture Partners, Supernode Ventures, and others.




About the Role

As our first hire, this is a tremendous opportunity to influence the growth of a new team and build a novel and impactful technology that improves the financial well-being of patients.




What You’ll Do

As an early member of our engineering team, you will work directly with the CTO and Head of Product to spec, design, and build the core product functionality
Specifically, you’ll work on expanding the functionality of our live MVP to optimize the user onboarding flow, enhance authentication, integrate with 3rd-party data providers we use for underwriting decisioning, build out the decision engine itself, and much more.
Be part of our weekly product development cycle where you'll convert product requirements into functionality.
Develop product intuition by spending time with our users and increasingly take ownership of coming up with product requirements.
Solve problems you don't know how to solve: You'll encounter challenges we haven't yet come across yet. And when the time comes, you'll think through problems, evaluate approaches and teach yourself whatever is needed.
Lay a solid foundation for the product to scale, keep our technical debt in check and help us hire a team of incredible engineers.
Have something you want to learn or accomplish in this role? Tell us about it! We want to give you the best career opportunity you've ever had.




What We’re Looking For

0-3 years of experience as a software engineer

Excitement and passion for expanding financial access to healthcare.
Experience with Java, a relational database, React (or a comparable front-end framework) and building full-stack web apps.
A great understanding of how Restful services and Gradle works
Our full tech stack includes: Docker, Spring, Gradle, Hibernate, ExpressJS, NextJS, Amazon Web Services, Java, N8N, Python

Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world’s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $39 trillion in assets every day and are the world’s third largest investment manager with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.

Recently we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.

This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).

What You Will Do

As a cloud engineer, you will deploy solutions in the public cloud (e.g., AWS) using configuration provisioning and management tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Python APIs). You are required to design configuration templates that are used to provision infrastructure components (i.e., EC2, RDS, EMR, Lambda etc.) in a scalable manner. Once in production your role is key to ensuring that solutions are performant and operational SLAs are maintained.

Develop applications (the ‘thread or if you prefer ‘duct tape’) that enable business and operational requirements using cloud provider services (‘fabric’ or ‘lego pieces’)
Make concepts ‘real’ by telling enterprise architects how things really work versus what they may have seen in a vendor demo
Avoid 2am production issues by building scalable and resilient (‘works the first time’) applications running globally
Make things better by pointing out redundancies and manual steps best handled via your code

Who You Are

Smart and prefer to have other fork your git repos (versus forking some open source project to show commit counts)
Experience using languages in vogue this decade (e.g., Python, Go, Groovy)
Aware of how cloud-centric architectures and technical standards differ from something that runs on a Windows server
Understand what are trade-offs in design and development (e.g., perennial issues around cache validation)
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering

Bonus Points

Graduate degree in Computer Engineering / Computer Science
GPA higher than the average in relevant subjects and in the last two academic years (if not throughout)
Prior experiences / internships with exposure to developing large scale applications
Have written apps using AWS services (a bit more than EC2 is always welcome)

About State Street

Across the globe, institutional investors rely on us to help them manage risk, respond to challenges, and drive performance and profitability. We keep our clients at the heart of everything we do, and smart, engaged employees are essential to our continued success.

Our promise to maintain an environment where every employee feels valued and able to meet their full potential infuses our company values.
