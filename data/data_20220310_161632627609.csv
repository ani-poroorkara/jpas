We believe that nobody should struggle financially to receive healthcare. Every year, 500,000 families in the United States declare bankruptcy due to large medical bills. People should not have their lives destroyed because they can’t afford something they require to survive. At Walnut, we’re on a mission to change this number from 500,000 bankruptcies per year to 0.

What we do

Walnut is a fintech company that expands financial access to healthcare. We’re building a point-of-sale embedded lending platform that makes healthcare more affordable for patients by breaking up large medical bills into small, monthly payments. This helps patients actually afford healthcare and helps healthcare providers capture more revenue and increase collections. We’re backed by prominent investors including Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused venture fund), Plaid, Afore Capital, 2048 Ventures, Newark Venture Partners, Supernode Ventures, and others.

What You’ll Do

As an early member of our engineering team, you will work directly with the CTO and Head of Product to spec, design, and build the core product functionality
Specifically, you’ll work on expanding the functionality of our live MVP to optimize the user onboarding flow, enhance authentication, integrate with 3rd-party data providers we use for underwriting decisioning, build out the decision engine itself, and much more.
Be part of our weekly product development cycle where you'll convert product requirements into functionality.
Develop product intuition by spending time with our users and increasingly take ownership of coming up with product requirements.
Solve problems you don't know how to solve: You'll encounter challenges we haven't yet come across yet. And when the time comes, you'll think through problems, evaluate approaches and teach yourself whatever is needed.
Lay a solid foundation for the product to scale, keep our technical debt in check and help us hire a team of incredible engineers.
Have something you want to learn or accomplish in this role? Tell us about it! We want to give you the best career opportunity you've ever had.




What We’re Looking For

0-3 years of experience as a software engineer
Hustle & Grit. Willingness and desire to take on personal responsibility for the business as a whole and “figure it out”, whether it’s in your exact functional lane or not.
Excitement and passion for expanding financial access to healthcare.
Experience with Java, a relational database, React (or a comparable front-end framework) and building full-stack web apps.
A great understanding of how Restful services and Gradle works
Our full tech stack includes: Docker, Spring, Gradle, Hibernate, ExpressJS, NextJS, Amazon Web Services, Java, N8N, Python

Good knowledge of Database concepts.
Ability to innovate and develop new approaches to complex design problems

COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

We host our services on Amazon Web Services and use things like RDS, Aurora, SQS, SNS, S3, Kafka, etc.
We are currently evolving our architecture to adopt event-driven design with Kafka as well as using GraphQL APIs to represent our data model

DESCRIPTION

Amazon is investing heavily in building a world class advertising business and we are responsible for defining and delivering a collection of self-service performance advertising products that drive discovery and sales. Our products are strategically important to our Retail and Marketplace businesses driving long term growth. We deliver billions of ad impressions and millions of clicks daily and are breaking fresh ground to create world-class products. We are highly motivated, collaborative and fun-loving with an entrepreneurial spirit and bias for action. With a broad mandate to experiment and innovate, we are growing at an unprecedented rate with a seemingly endless range of new opportunities.

Tens of billion dollars will be spent on advertising this year, and Amazon Sponsored Products is increasingly grabbing a larger and larger piece of the pie. We are looking for exceptional software engineers to build the ad serving and rendering services for our next generation, cost-per-click ad network.

We operate at the intersection of eCommerce and advertising. Our mission is to enhance discoverability for all products sold online and connect Amazon customers with sellers and selection anywhere. Our job is a multi-dimensional optimization problem. We choose ads for a given context that need to be relevant and useful to shopping customers, have the best value possible for merchant advertisers, and meet a high quality bar for publisher showing that. If it's not hard enough satisfying those conflicting demands, we need to do it all in &lt30ms, thousands of times per second.

We are a highly motivated, collaborative and fun-loving team building a high growth business. We are entrepreneurial and have a bias for action with a broad mandate to experiment and innovate. This is an opportunity to make a significant impact on the future of the Amazon vision.

The ideal candidate for this role has strong experience in designing and developing scalable high-performance systems and services that are flexible, reliable, and maintainable. You have excellent problem-solving skills, a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals, and a customer-focused mindset. You take pragmatic and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams. You will build services to handle billions of requests per day, while maintaining response latencies in the milliseconds and meeting strict SLA requirements. Our systems and algorithms operate on one of the world's largest product catalogs and it is quite routine for our systems to operate on massive datasets using distributed frameworks.

A successful candidate will have the satisfaction of seeing their work on the Amazon.com website and numerous other websites, where it will be viewed by tens of millions of customers and will drive quantifiable revenue impact, broaden their technical skills and work in an environment that thrives on creativity, experimentation, and product innovation.

Good knowledge of Database concepts.
Ability to innovate and develop new approaches to complex design problems

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted.

COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

Our software engineers are the gurus behind the scenes ensuring our all of our programs are easy to use and bug free. Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.

Unsure where to start? Apply and explore all of the possibilities in Applications Development, Database Development, Embedded Networking and OS Development, IT, Security, Test & Quality, Web Services, etc.

Who You’ll Work With

Our team of software gurus are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.

You would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you'll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they’re on.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

You will push for and maintain best practices, such as testing in DBT, performant SQL, and consistent code standards (e.g. Fishtown style guide).
You will communicate thoroughly with the product team, designers, engineers, and sometimes customers to understand user needs and nuances in RXNT’s data.
With the help of your engineering manager, you will often provide both optimistic and pessimistic time estimates for your work.
